// Container With Most Water Problem
// Given an Int array input of height of length N. There are N vertical lines drawn such that the
// two endpoints of ith line are (i,0) (i, height[i])
// find the two lines that together with the X-axis form a container, such that the container contains most water.
// return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

// Hint this problem has nothing to do with Water.
// Area = min(h1,h2) * width
// where width is 1 unit from each height

// we take min of two heights since any water over the minimum height will spill over and therefore
// cannot be held by the container

//BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION 1

        var maxi = 0
